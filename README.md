# ðŸ“˜ DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice repository!  
This repo contains all the problems and solutions Iâ€™ve been working on as part of my DSA preparation journey.

## ðŸ“š Source:

Iâ€™m following the [DSA Sheet by Apni Kaksha](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hXserPuxVoWMG9Hs7y8wVdRCJTcj3xMBAEYUOXQ5Xag/edit?gid=0#gid=0), which includes a comprehensive set of problems covering all major DSA topics.

## Progress:

- âœ… **Arrays** â€” Completed  
- ðŸ”„ **Strings** â€” Currently solving **hard-level** problems

## Goals:

- Strengthen core problem-solving skills
- Prepare for coding interviews
- Develop clean and efficient coding habits

## Technologies:

- Language: Python3
- Platform: Practicing mostly on LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and InterviewBit
